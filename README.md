# BrewCat

Welcome! ðŸ™‚

BrewCat is a simple **_cat_**â€Šalog (see what I did here?) to browse and find new beers from the BrewDog brewery.

It uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (hooks!) as the main technology together with some other great piece of software:

1. [EasyPeasy](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy) for state management
1. [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing
1. [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons) for styling

The project is available on Netlify at [https://brewcat.netlify.com](https://brewcat.netlify.com), but if you like you can run it on your machine as well.

To do so, first you must clone the project and install its dependencies:

1. `git clone git@github.com:stenowtf/brewcat.git`
1. `cd brewcat`
1. `npm install`

After that you can see the results:

1. `npm run build`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your favourite browser

Enjoy!
